# Personal Website

Made with React.js and used to be hosted at [jackviel.com](https://jackviel.com/).

I initially planned on fleshing this out with a couple of react.js elements but instead opted to make a [blog using Jekyll](https://github.com/jackviel/Personal-Blog-Jekyll) that's hosted now hosted on [jackviel.com](https://jackviel.com/) :)
